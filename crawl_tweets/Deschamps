To koniec ale #Mou RT @GFFN: RMC pundit Christophe Dugarry: "Paul Pogba must leave Manchester United, he is at loggerheads with Jos√© Mourinho. So I'd say to him prepare for the World Cup &amp; get the hell out of there. Deschamps must speak to him on the phone about this."

@Puchkin_B Reims for me though I accept it's not easy to pronounce.   Also those who pronounce most things well yet pronounce the c in Blanc or the s in Deschamps.
