Julius #Caesar was assassinated by his own senators #onthisday in 44 B.C. This coin commemorates the act, with a portrait of #Brutus on the front and "Eid Mar," or #IdesOfMarch, emblazoned on the back along with two daggers and a liberty cap. #TodayInHistory https://t.co/bIkQ8DhbeW

Today is the #IdesOfMarch, where you re-examine your friends and decide whether any of them are a) using you for their own advantage, b) not really 'friends' and c) really into knives right now. If you find any? Get rid of them. Toxic friendship is worse than no friendship.

One year ago today, we lost my father-in-law, Ernie Davenport. He was a WWII vet. He trained pilots and was a co-pilot on a B-17. He went on to teach kids, and coach FB, which was his true love.  He was a great second dad to me and is sadly missed. RIP, Dad. RIP.   #IdesOfMarch https://t.co/SGHmYPvwSw

Beware the Ides of March! Today is the day Julius Caesar was assassinated 2061 years ago in 44 B.C.E. In April 1882, Lawrence Barrett, a well-known 19th century American actor, played Cassius in “Julius Caesar” at Dicksons’ Grand Opera House in Indianapolis. #IdesOfMarch #Theater https://t.co/wWMAsAMQxC

March 15 aka the #IdesOfMarch. I love this day because, historically, it’s a day associated with loyalty. Why? Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 B.C. on March 15 and his confidant, Brutus, was the one to lead the plan for Caesar’s assassination. #BewareTheIdesOfMarch #history

It's the #IdesofMarch and also the 74th day of 2018, which means that only 80% (292 days) of 2018 are left!  Last chance to get a B for whatever it is you want to accomplish this year!  Do the things!  Put in the work!

Only supported Bill Clinton's crime bill b/c the Violence Against Women Act and assault weapons ban was included. He endorsed Jesse Jackson for President in 1984 and 1988.
