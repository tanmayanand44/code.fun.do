@actonblue @BBCBreaking Pre-Brexit, the #tax incentives weren't an issue perhaps, but we all know #Unilever didn't go to Netherlands b'cos of The customs union, b'cos apart from #Britain , the #Dutch are the next influential partners in Unilever.

From now on, if someone next to you smells bad, it's probably a Brexiter boycotting Unilever. https://t.co/Q8jCgDI1Vj
